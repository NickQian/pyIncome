# pyIncome
to see the "socialism" income curve possibility

# don't fork this.
When I have time I will update with:  <br>
1)different sharps in one diagram to see the change made between years. <br>
2)the most interest thing: the weight of different social hierarchies, and the "investable" weight of different social hierarchies. <br>
3)bases on "socialist public ownership" how the "Income curve" can be. <br>

# usage example: <br>
$python logNrm_dist.py
